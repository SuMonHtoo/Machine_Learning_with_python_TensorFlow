## Speed Limit Sign Detection and Recognition for Intelligent Speed Adaptation Using Faster R-CNN and Arduino Microcontroller
### Description
Final year thesis - Speed-limit signs detection and recognition system is constructed using faster R-CNN, Google's Tensorflow object detection model. The serialized data results are computed and transferred to arduino microcontroller using python programming language in Anaconda environment to control wheel motors speed of robot car model.
